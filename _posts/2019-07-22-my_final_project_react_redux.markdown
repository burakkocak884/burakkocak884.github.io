I just wanted to begin with saying that I never knew how complex making an advance app would be. There are so many files and objects that function together flawlessly in order to satisfy a user’s needs/expectations. When you consider creating an app that works very fast and it is bug free,  you better think of power of React/Redux .React and Redux(maintained by FaceBook) provides such an advance library that a developer such as myself has chance to create an app to serve users of future.
	In my React/Redux app, I have created a data base , and seeded in some data to make sure that my app works as it should be. First section I created was rails part as in back-end to serve my data to React/Redux as in front-end. Once I collected the data that I needed, 
I called in actions of Redux to manipulate it and display as user desired.  Adding some CSS style made it look nicer and easier for user to read the data. React/Redux seemed very complicated at first. I started to understand it better as I wrestle with errors. I did lots of reach on how to connect different parts of the app and how to send data from one place to another. I have learned a lot while working on this project.  My understanding of logic in the project grew rapidly as I used “debugger” and “conslole.log” more often. 
At the end, I begin to think of whole  new strategies/ides on what I can do to make better apps for future.
