Object Oriented Ruby is really a great way to understand how objects relate each other. At first , it seems very complicated to understand how different objects are associated through some attributes. Once understood how they work, it is almost like a magic but done by you. I think that OOP( Object Oriented Programming)carries any programmer to a different level of proramming.
