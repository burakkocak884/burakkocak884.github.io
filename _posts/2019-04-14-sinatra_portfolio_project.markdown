This is my first Sinatra Project ever.
 
		First  of all, writing a code for this project started out as very challenging for me because I couldn't visualize the connections between routes and html files.  As I started to follow a set pattern step by step when it comes to CRUD( create, read, update and delete), this started to make sense. Creating and establishing a well working database was my first goal, and yet it was  the most challenging one.  Running into migration and seeding issues were very easy to get to. So , once the database was running error-free, setting routes and navigating a user to right direction were my next goal. providing a user a real experience when it comes to managing rental properties were also challenging. 

During working on this project , I gained so much knowledge about ActiveRecord, Database, and Sinatra that I feel more confident about creating a dynamic web app than I have ever had. My experience working in this project turn put to be very similar to first one (CLI Gem Project). It started as very overwhelming at times. As I made progress, things started to fall into their places and make much more sense. 

Conclusion, planning ahead on what idea to implement in this project made things less complicated and helped me speed up my progress. At the end, I created an app that passed beyond my expectations.
