My JavaScript project is  the Rails app that I had created in the past , and now my rails app functions with the power of Javascript magic.

		Hearing about how javascript is a big portion of web app development in these days has always excited me. Being able to create an app with javascript is a really powerful skill. It requires lots of knowledge and logic. As a software developer , it makes me happy to see how my app functions in advance way like other apps. Implementing javascript function into my app was very challenging at times. 
         First, Deciding where to start including javascript and linking “.js” files  to front-end files was difficult at first. I kept getting different errors or no-action  sometimes when I clicked on icons. That frustrated me a lot.  With gradience and ton of search online , I was able to get the different files to communicate. 

		Second, once I decided on what to include in my app and what path to follow, things started to fall in right places. Tracking a problem was the main focus during the process, and “debugger” was my best friend if I could catch it during executing the code. 
       Third, going deeper in associations and trying to track how serializers make the associations  were interesting to see. 
  Finally, completing this project really taught me a lot on how to think logically and connect different objects auto-magically. I can’t wait to create way more advance app with javascript to serve people’s needs in the future and change the world one line of code at a time.
