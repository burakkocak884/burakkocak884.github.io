 I created a app called "worldcup" which is an application that brings information to a  user from the biggest sports
 
 even in the history, FIFA WorldCup. The app is created using 

Subime text editor. 


The App contains:
 
  --> A run file.
 
 --> CLI file.
 
 --> Class files.
 
 --> An environment file.
 
 
 1) **Run File**
 
 Run file is the first thing that user types in terminal to run the app. 
 
 2)**CLI File**

CLI files is responsible for displaying a welcome message, It will list options for user, and it will 

take an input. Then it will 

display correct information depends on what the input is.

3) **Class files**

Class files are responsible creating/initializing instances, create object relations within other    

classes. They will also associate the data from websites with instances created. 

4)**Environment File**

Environment file called worldcup.rb is responsible linking all the files and getting required 
gems. 




**Conclusion**


               Completing the project and meeting requirements were challenging at times. However ,

 reaching useful resources helped me pass through obstacles. I have learned a lot more than 

what I knew before I started working in this project. I am very grateful that I gained new skills 

and knowledge while fixing errors along the steps.
