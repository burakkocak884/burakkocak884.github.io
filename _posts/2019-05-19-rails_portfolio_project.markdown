                    The first rails project I have ever worked on.
										
* It is has been a challenging  three weeks since we have started working on Ruby on Rails Section.
* Mastering Sinatra app helped me understand how Ruby on Rails functioned in the back-ground. 
* Creating a diagram and associations of the tables  helped  me be visualize how to operate the app from a user perspective. 
* Implementing tables, models and controllers were challenging at times. Getting MVC and CRUD working properly was taking most of the time. 
* Front-end of the app was mostly straight forward once other parts of the app functioned as it should. Including some CSS code to my
* view pages made the app look more appealing to a user. 
* 
* First Step was to create a new rails app from scratch. Second, I had to make sure that I had included all the gems  in my gem file that I
* would need to in order to create the app more accurate and faster. Next, I was required to add an authentication  for user to control his/her 
* log in’s and to give user an option of signing in through a different source which was GITHUB  in my app. 
* Lastly, I had to mare sure that my app “Top Gear Tech” met all the requirements instructed by Flatiron.
* Working on this app in last a few days was  very challenging yet, it was also very rewarding. Creating an app that worked  worth every min spend at computer dest and library. 
* I am happy to say that I have learned a lot working on this project, and I am very excited to see what is next.
