In this journey with FlatIron  School, I have learned a lot. I have overcome many challenges.  

        When I first decided to join FlatIron school, I was introduced course prep like many students here. I have always had Windows Operating System, and I am much more comfortable with it. However, I have crashed my Windows OS several times running different applications. So, I decided to get a Mac PC. It has been only a couple of weeks that I started working on the course prep. When I saw the very first error in my terminal after executing the code, it did not make any sense. To be honest,   I did not know what to look for.  I was going back and forth between my text editor(Sublime) and the terminal. Not to mention, I was still getting used to Mac.  I was trying to search the error code online to see what I need to do to go to the next step. I wasn’t getting anywhere. So, I decided to pay more attention to what is going in the terminal. I broke the content of the error into pieces and then I tried to understand what it is looking from me to implement. Then, I tried to find more information on each piece online. Little by little, they way pieces connect to each started making sense. It took time and lots of research to get comfortable with it. In the first weeks of the course,  I was still getting freaked out when I saw some different error codes. As time has passed, the error codes seemed more friendly to me. I was communication better, I was reading it better, and I was getting better on what to look in an error code. Reading a test file step by step also gave me an idea of what was going on in different parts of the code. At the moment there are about five more weeks to complete the course, and I am happy to say that the error codes transitioned from being a monster to be my best friend in coding. 

    So, don’t fear when you see an error. Instead, try to understand what it is trying guide you to. The error codes helped me become a better coder and it will help you too.
